            <p class="special">Electing a government official is a pivotal event that happens every three and six years. Republic Act No. 7166 mandates that “there shall be simultaneous regular elections for national and local officials once every three (3) years, and that the President and Vice-President shall be elected every six (6) years.” 
                Every elected official holds the power to influence their domain—and the future of a community and the country depends on this decision, which is why choosing the right candidate is more than essential. </p>

            <p class="special">A polling station refers to the designated voting area where registered Filipino voters will cast their votes. It is based on one’s most recent registered address, or precinct. While most polling stations are usually in public schools, during the 2025 election, the COMELEC decided to offer polling sites in malls for the countrymen’s convenience.</p>

            <p class="special">The youth play a decisive role in shaping the nation’s democratic future. As José Rizal once said, “Ang kabataan ang pag-asa ng bayan,” a reminder that the direction of the country rests in the hands of its youngest citizens. 
                Through informed and responsible voting, the youth have the power to influence governance, uphold democratic values, and advocate for meaningful reforms. When young voters participate actively and wisely in elections, they help ensure that the nation moves toward progress, transparency, and lasting change. </p>
