            <p class="roam">One of the most essential qualities of a responsible voter is being scrupulous. Voters should thoroughly evaluate each candidate before deciding. Questions such as “What is their educational background?”, “If they have previously held office, what have they accomplished?”, and “Do they have any existing criminal records?” are among the important considerations that can guide voters toward a wise and informed choice. </p>
            <p class="roam">Another important quality is being open-minded. Voters should be willing to consider candidates from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, even if they differ from their own beliefs. This openness can lead to a more inclusive and representative government that better serves the needs of all citizens.</p>
            <p class="roam">Here are some of the questions the authors recommend you ask potential candidates to ensure that your vote supports someone who is truly capable, trustworthy, and aligned with the needs of the community. </p>

            <ul style="list-style: decimal-leading-zero;">
                <li>What is their educational background? Do they have a college degree or relevant training that can help them perform well in the office? 
                    If not, what have they done to make up for it?</li>
                <li>If they had previously held office, what have they accomplish? 
                    Were the platforms or promises they published in their previous term implemented or showing progress? </li>
                <li>Do they have any relatives elected as politicians? Candidates who are part of political dynasties may prioritize family interests over public service.
                    Avoid supporting candidates who rely on family connections rather than their own merits and achievements. </li>
                <li>Do they have any history of corruption, abuse of power, or unethical behavior? 
                    Review their past actions and decisions to see if they have been involved in corruption, bribery, or misuse of public resources. 
                    Assess their integrity and accountability.</li>
                <li>Do they have any existing criminal records? Understand that public service requires high ethical standards, and a criminal history may compromise their ability to govern responsibly.
                    Not everyone deserves a second chance, particularly when their decisions can impact the welfare of the entire country. </li>
                <li>What values and principles do they uphold? Identify the candidate’s core beliefs and priorities—do they align with ethical governance, transparency, and social responsibility? 
                    Ensure their beliefs and priorities align with ethical governance and the needs of the community. </li>
            </ul>
